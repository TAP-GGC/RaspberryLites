How are we going to simplify the code for a 6th grader  



Steps we took:
    For MVP(and begginners):
     gpiozero
Easy way to get them into small functions and algorithmic programming using
small lights and a breadboard, powersupply, and a monitor


For intermediate level:
 rpi_ws281x
 adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel
    with light strips
More complex and more freedom for change in the event of a larger programmer

For the TAP expo:
    1 use case => using the intermediate setup

for s3:
    Ideally 5 different workshop setups with a webserver esq manamgement system. 
    to remote into the RaspberryPi for demonstration
