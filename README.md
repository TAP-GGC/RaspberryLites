## :loudspeaker: About - 
The objective of the workshop is to remind and demonstrate to students the innerworkings of making physical applications with code. In a world that is heavy focused on software and digital products, we want to present an application that reminds those curious about tech that it can also be applied in real life situations with a little creativity.

<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants 
understand the process themselves by going hands on into making their own project. They will be able to learn how the different devices are connected together, what software is needed to initialize the project and how they can create their own program to run their own application seamlessly. They will be able to troubleshoot with our team members if they run into problems and demonstrate their light show to others when they are done!
