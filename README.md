## :loudspeaker: About - 
The objective of the workshop is to remind and demonstrate to students the innerworkings of making physical applications with code. In a world that is heavy focused on software and digital products, we want to present an application that reminds those curious about tech that it can also be applied in real life situations with a little creativity.

<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants 
understand the process themselves by going hands on into making their own project. They will be able to learn how the different devices are connected together, what software is needed to initialize the project and how they can create their own program to run their own application seamlessly. They will be able to troubleshoot with our team members if they run into problems and demonstrate their light show to others when they are done!

<!-- 
Your Options for target audience: 
  - High School
  - College
  - Middle School
  - K-12
  - Non-Stem
  - Undergraduate
You can select from a range of audiences or a single auidience. Examples: 
    Middle School - College 
    High School - College
    K-12
  You will be presenting most often to your peers who are taking introductory technology classes, so more often than not you should be including college in your target audience range.

* <b>Difficulty Level:</b> Beginner - Intermediate
* <b>Target Audience:</b> K12 - College Students
* <b>Duration of Workshop:</b> 45 minute workshop
* <b>Needed Materials:</b> Rasperry Pi 3 boards, 60 Pixel LED Strips, IR non-contact temp sensors, microphone sensors, Breadboards, wire connectors,  Monitors.
* <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> The primary goal of this project is to teach participants how code can be applied to physical applications and to boost creativity in thinking outside the computer screen.
* <b>Main Technology:</b> Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer that's used for a variety of projects, including digital art, education, and home automation. 
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) <b>(TAP)</b> is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
You can use a Raspberry Pi to control an LED strip by connecting it to the Pi’s GPIO pins. We potentially aim to make this a part of the workshop so students can be hands on with the hardware aspect of the project. With Python, you can write a script to turn the LEDs on/off, change colors, or create lighting effects. With hopes of creating a dynamic light show script. We aim to teach students how to edit or add to the script to make their own light show.
You could also add features like remote control via a web interface or smartphone app, or automate lighting based on time or sensors. Depending on the participants skill level, we could also incorporate these such features.

* The Raspberry Pi is an affordable, compact computer that’s great for learning, DIY projects, and experimentation. Its small size, low cost, and extensive community support make it ideal for coding, IoT, and hardware projects. We want to showcase just a few ways that it can be implemented to go beyond digital limitations and bring out applications that we can see and feel in the physical world.
