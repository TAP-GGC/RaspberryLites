## :loudspeaker: About - 
The objective of the workshop is to remind and demonstrate to students the innerworkings of making physical applications with code. In a world that is heavy focused on software and digital products, we want to present an application that reminds those curious about tech that it can also be applied in real life situations with a little creativity.

<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants 
understand the process themselves by going hands on into making their own project. They will be able to learn how the different devices are connected together, what software is needed to initialize the project and how they can create their own program to run their own application seamlessly. They will be able to troubleshoot with our team members if they run into problems and demonstrate their light show to others when they are done!

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
This workshop is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in programming and hardware interaction using Python 3, Thonny IDE, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and with WS281B LED light strips. The primary objective of this project is to introduce students to programming using Python 3 on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with the Thonny IDE. The workshop aims to build a foundational understanding of algorithms while enabling students to create their own interactive programs. To reinforce their learning, students will complete a coding challenge by writing a small algorithm of our choosing. This task, tailored to their average skill level, will demonstrate their understanding of key programming principles. By the end of the workshop, participants will have hands-on experience with Python, algorithmic thinking, and hardware interaction using the Raspberry Pi.  Students will then engage in a hands-on activity where they control LED light strips using Python to visualize algorithms in action. The goal is to recreate a light show using the given tools and explain how it was recreated. The survey will cover key topics such as LED strip wiring, power management, the role of pins, and algorithmic concepts. By comparing pre- and post-survey results, we will track progress, identify areas for improvement, and gather participant feedback. The survey will indicate the progress of the students and how their core programming skills improve after participating in the Raspberry Pi light show. The goal is to introduce fundamental programming concepts through an engaging, hands-on platform: a Raspberry Pi-powered LED light strip system. By using light patterns to visualize algorithms, K-12 students and non-IT college students will develop an intuitive understanding of algorithmic thinking. With our surveys we can better understand how well integrated our teaching strategy is and how impactful it is on students that have not been familiarized with IT concepts.

* The Raspberry Pi is an affordable, compact computer that’s great for learning, DIY projects, and experimentation. Its small size, low cost, and extensive community support make it ideal for coding, IoT, and hardware projects. We want to showcase just a few ways that it can be implemented to go beyond digital limitations and bring out applications that we can see and feel in the physical world.
